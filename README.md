# Coding Katas

Wrap-ups of the katas I performed during coding dojos or which I prepared for such events. Serves to get you quickly started with your own sessions. Mind that not the code is the main part, but the preparation for it.
Each folder contains one kata with a description of its own.

## How to read?

The folder layout is roughly as follows:

+ Description and optional other stuff in the main folder.
+ **kata** if any source code is needed to start the dojo
+ **sessions** various attempts to solve the kata, may-be none
+ **feedback** impressions and feedback loops for theses sessions

## Which kata for what?

Simple katas are good to train basics and to reflect what you are actually doing and to learn completely new stuff or languages.

We applied baby steps on **FizzBuzz**, used no mouse or trackpad on **Anagrams**, played ping pong driver and navigator on **String Calculator**, or learned a bit of Scala with **99 bottles of beer**. Rinse and repeat with **Histograms** or **Roman numbers**.

Advanced katas however need a bit of a different setup.

### Refactor

Refactor legacy code with **Golden Master** or improve the famous **Gilded Rose**.

### Design

Try to execute a simple kata with an introductory **Pen and Paper** session.
