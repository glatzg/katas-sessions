Coding Katas
============

Wrap-ups of the katas I performed during coding dojos or which I prepared for such events. Serves to get you quickly started with your own sessions. Mind that not the code is the main part, but the preparation for it.
Each folder contains one kata with a description of its own.

The folder layout is roughly as follows:

+ Description and optional other stuff in the main folder.
+ **kata** if any source code is needed to start the dojo
+ **sessions** various attempts to solve the kata, may-be none
+ **feedback** impressions and feedback loops for theses sessions
