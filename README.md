# Coding Katas Sessions

Wrap-ups of the katas I performed during coding dojos or which I prepared for such events. Serves to get you quickly started with your own sessions. Mind that not the code is the main part, but the preparation for it.

Each folder contains one session. Each session consists of the kata which you likely find in the kata catalogue (http://goeckeler.com/katas.git) and the constraints for which it was used. For example "fizz-buzz-no-mouse" is the Fizz Buzz kata run with no mouse or touchpad attached.

## How to read?

The folder layout is roughly as follows:

+ Description and optional other stuff in the main folder.
+ A folder for a unique session.
+ Sessions may contain a feedback folder for impressions and feedback loops.

## Looks different right now

Yeah, simply because I screwed up in the past and mixed katas, sessions, lessons and so on. Will evolve in the next couple of months.
